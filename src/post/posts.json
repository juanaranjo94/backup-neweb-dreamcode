Therefore, creating websites that fully meet the needs and capabilities of the devices from which they will be accessed is a standard that all programmers oriented to mobile development cannot fail to meet.\n\nIn this context, this article will cover five current techniques of responsive web design to achieve high level of adaptability and visual quality developments.\n\n## What is Responsive Design?\n\nWhen it is said that a website has responsive design or responsive, basically it is saying that its visual structure is correctly adapted to the resolution of the screen on which it is being displayed. In this way it manages to deliver to its visitors an optimized and improved UI/UX experience, which positively impacts on increasing traffic to the site, decreases bounce rates and improves its positioning among other benefits.\n\n## The responsive design techniques that best respond to brand positioning\n\n### 1. Remove obstacles to the visitor\n\nMake sure there is no friction between the user's navigation and their goal, if they want to buy help them achieve it in a few steps.\n\n### 2. Lean on native hardware\n\nTake advantage of the resources that mobile devices can provide you with, these are integrated cameras, GPS, two-step authentication, etc.\n\n### 3. Program with fluidity and adaptability as main objectives\n\nFor example, you can rely on the use of SVG images that do not lose quality if they are enlarged or reduced.\n\n### 4. Design for the thumb\n\nFor desktop websites the navigation is usually at the top, on mobile it should be at the bottom.\n\n### 5. Consider typography as the ultimate detail.\n\nmake font sizes adapt directly proportional to the resolution of the screen where the website is projected.\n\nTo close, 94% of visitors rate it according to its delivery and responsiveness and more than 60% do it from mobile. These are enough reasons for DreamCode to have a team of high-level developers with the knowledge and experience necessary to develop responsive sites that provide the best experience for your visitors and attract more qualified traffic according to your business objectives.

        "content": "\nA growing trend indicates that both companies and programmers are looking for technological innovation through the development of efficient, sustainable, scalable and, above all, low-cost web or mobile applications. This has brought into consideration the viability of HTML5 since it is a simple, versatile, developer-friendly and open source language, which means that it does not require any investment for professional use. For that reason, in this article we will break down roughly what is involved in developing mobile applications with HTML5 to better understand this technological trend.\n\n## What is an HTML5 app?\n\nHTML5 allows the creation of WORA (write once run everywhere) applications, which in Spanish translates as \"write once run everywhere\" applications that can be executed in any environment.\n\nStructurally, these apps are a collection of web pages based on HTML code which are delivered by means of CSS style sheets in conjunction with JavaScript. In this way HTML5 apps achieve the integration of different structure and design elements along with the necessary APIs for proper deployment on multiple devices and platforms.\n\n## Which are the pros and cons of developing HTML5 apps?\n\n### Pros\n\n**Learning and implementation**\n\nOn a general level, HTML is the starting point where developers begin their professional journey. This demonstrates its ease of learning and ensures that there will always be talent available for development compared to other languages.\n\n**Investment and profitability**\n\nHTML5 does not require royalty payments to be implemented in professional projects. In addition, its cross-platform deployment prevents companies from having to develop native applications for each platform.\n\n**Adaptability and integration**\n\nHTML5 applications adjust to the resolutions, screen sizes and aspect ratios where they run. They also integrate seamlessly with the operating system of any device.\n\n**Maintenance and Upgradeability**\n\nThe clean, clean code achieved with HTML5 ensures easy-to-maintain applications. Also, updating it is uncomplicated and requires no action on the part of users.\n\n### Cons\n\n**Permissions and access**\n\nHTML5 cannot access all the functionalities of cell phones, in fact it can only do so through APIs and this can limit its capabilities and advantages over native applications.\n\n**Communication and deployment**\n\nHTML5 was developed quickly and has not yet solved some compatibility bugs in the deployment of CSS attributes, HTML tags and JavaScript APIs, this can generate communication failures on some devices.\n\nIn conclusion, despite having certain disadvantages, there are more successes that the development of HTML5 apps can achieve. This has motivated companies like Intel to generate campaigns to help programmers to achieve a transition from the native environment to the multiplatform environment proposed by HTML5.\nIf your company has the challenge of implementing one or more cross-platform mobile applications, HTML5 is probably the ideal language to face this task and overcome it with peace of mind, but first, you need to have the right team to develop this solution.\n\nSo, if you are looking to transform this business challenge into an opportunity for progress, it's time to meet us and schedule a consultation so that together we can work on the technological initiative that will take your company to a new level of services and benefits.
